To build the darknet executable, just run $make in this folder. Follow the darknet instructions for use of the binary. If you want to run the test java code, use $java xikuiw.volcano.hermit.analyzer.ObjectDetector %img file path%. The img path can be a url in a format that is accepted by OpenCV for video such as .mjpeg or it can be a filename on your host system.
